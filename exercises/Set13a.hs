-- Ex 1: Your task is to help implement the function readName that
-- given a string like "Forename Surname" produces the pair
-- ("Forename", "Surname"). readName should fail (return Nothing) in
-- the following cases:
--
--   1. the input string doesn't contain a space
--   2. one of the names contains numbers
--   3. one of the names doesn't start with a capital letter
--
-- The function readNames has already been implemented using the ?>
-- operator from the course material. You need to define the helper
-- functions split, checkNumber and checkCapitals so that readNames
-- works correctly.

(?>) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
Nothing ?> _ = Nothing   -- In case of failure, propagate failure
Just x  ?> f = f x       -- In case of sucess, run the next computation

-- DO NOT touch this definition!
readNames :: String -> Maybe (String,String)
readNames s =
  split s
  ?>
  checkNumber
  ?>
  checkCapitals

-- split should split a string into two words. If the input doesn't
-- contain a space, Nothing should be returned
--
-- (NB! There are obviously other corner cases like the inputs " " and
-- "a b c", but you don't need to worry about those here)
split :: String -> Maybe (String,String)
split str = go [] str
  where go built (' ':rest) = Just (built, rest)
        go built (c:rest)   = go (built++[c]) rest
        go _     []         = Nothing

-- checkNumber should take a pair of two strings and return them
-- unchanged if they don't contain numbers. Otherwise Nothing is
-- returned.
checkNumber :: (String, String) -> Maybe (String, String)
checkNumber (str1, str2) =
  case and [b1, b2] of

    otherwise -> Nothing
  where check str = map (not . isDigit) str
        b1 = and (check str1)
        b2 = and (check str2)

-- unchanged if both start with a capital letter. Otherwise Nothing is
-- returned.
checkCapitals :: (String, String) -> Maybe (String, String)
checkCapitals (for,sur) =

-- Ex 2: Given a list of players and their scores (as [(String,Int)]),
-- and two player names, return the name of the player who has more
-- points (wrapped in a Just), or Nothing if either of the players
-- doesn't exist.
--
-- In the case of a draw, prefer the first player.
--
-- Use the function
--   lookup :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b
-- and either do-notation (easier) or ?> chaining (trickier!)
--
-- Examples:
--   winner [("ender",13),("orson",6),("scott",5)] "ender" "orson"
--     ==> Just "ender"
--   winner [("ender",13),("orson",6),("scott",5)] "orson" "ender"

--   winner [("ender",13),("orson",6),("scott",5)] "orson" "scott"
--     ==> Just "orson"
--   winner [("ender",13),("orson",6),("scott",5)] "orson" "ridley"
--     ==> Nothing
--   winner [("a",1),("b",1)] "a" "b"
--     ==> Just "a"

-- Ex 3: given a list of indices and a list of values, return the sum
-- of the values in the given indices. You should fail if any of the

--
-- Use the Maybe monad, i.e. the >>= operator or do-notation.
--
-- Hint! implement a function safeIndex :: [a] -> Int -> Maybe a
--

--  selectSum [0..10] [4,6,9]
--    Just 19
--  selectSum [0..10] [4,6,9,20]
--    Nothing

-- Ex 4: Here is the Logger monad from the course material. Implement

-- Ex 5: You can find the Bank and BankOp code from the course
-- material in the module Examples.Bank (file

--
-- Implement a BankOp balance that produces the balance of the given

-- operation shouldn't change the state of the Bank. The functions
-- from Data.Map are available under the prefix Map.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Ex 6: Using the operations balance, withdrawOp and depositOp, and
-- chaining (+>), implement the BankOp rob, which transfers all the
-- money from one account to another account.
--
-- Examples:
--   runBankOp (balance "harry") exampleBank
--     ==> (10,Bank (fromList [("cedric",7),("ginny",1),("harry",10)]))
--   runBankOp (balance "sean") exampleBank

-- Ex 7: using the State monad, write the operation `update` that first
-- multiplies the state by 2 and then adds one to it. The state has
-- type Int.
--
-- Example:
--  runState update 3
--    ==> ((),7)

update :: State Int ()
update = state (\s -> ((), (s*2)+1))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Ex 8: Checking that parentheses are balanced with the State monad.
--
-- Do this by implementing the function paren, which updates the state
-- based on a single character. A '(' should increase the state, and a
-- ')' should decrease the state. If the state goes to -1 (there are
-- more closing than opening parentheses), it should stay there to
-- indicate that a parenthesis error was encountered.
--
-- After you've implemented paren, the given definition of parensMatch
-- should work.
--
-- Examples:
--   runState (paren '(') 3    ==> (4,())
--   runState (paren ')') 3    ==> (2,())
--   runState (paren ')') 0    ==> (-1,())
--   runState (paren ')') (-1) ==> (-1,())
--   runState (paren '(') (-1) ==> (-1,())
--   parensMatch "()"          ==> True
--   parensMatch "("           ==> False
--   parensMatch "())"         ==> False
--   parensMatch "(()(()()))"  ==> True
--   parensMatch "(()((()))"   ==> False

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Ex 9: using a state of type [(a,Int)] we can keep track of the
-- numbers of occurrences of elements of type a. For instance
-- [('a',1),('x',3)] means that we've seen one 'a' and three 'x's.
--
-- Implement a State monad operation count that registers the
-- occurrence of the given value.
--
-- That is, the operation `count x` should fetch the pair `(x,n)` from
-- the state, and replace it with the pair `(x,n+1)`. If no such pair
-- is found, the operation should add `(x,1)` to the state.
--
-- Examples:
--  runState (count True) []
--    ==> ((),[(True,1)])
--  runState (count 7) []
--    ==> ((),[(7,1)])
--  runState (count 'a') [('a',1),('b',3)]
--    ==> ((),[('a',2),('b',3)])
--  runState (count 'a' >> count 'b' >> count 'a') []
--    ==> ((),[('a',2),('b',1)])
--
-- PS. The order of the list of pairs doesn't matter

  | otherwise = (k,v):count' x kvs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Ex 10: Implement the operation occurrences, which
--   1. runs the count operation on each element in the input list
--   2. finally produces the number of different items stored in the
--      state
--
-- In other words, use the state monad to count how many unique values
-- occur in a list.
--
-- Examples:
--  runState (occurrences [True,True,True,False,False]) []
--    ==> (2,[(True,3),(False,2)])
--  runState (occurrences [5,5,6,6,5,6,7]) []
--    ==> (3,[(5,3),(6,3),(7,1)])
--  runState (occurrences [True,False]) [(True,1)]
--    ==> (2,[(True,2),(False,1)])
--  runState (occurrences [4,7]) [(2,1),(3,1)]
